 <h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>“The Punishment” is almost entirely told through text and illustration, with only two examples of photography and video at the end. The choice to use illustration is likely due to the nature of the story they are presenting. They can’t photograph past events, but they still want the visual aspect of the struggles that Tetteh faces. Text description of her pain and fear, as opposed to seeing it on her face, wouldn’t have been as effective. The visual of her husband’s ghost also gives us more insight into her own perspective, with the blood staining his shirt and his solemn expression playing into her terror.</p>

<p>There is greater control of the amount of detail in each illustration, which can put more focus on certain subjects. For example, when Tetteh is giving birth, the faces of the workers around her are significantly less detailed than her own, leading the viewer to see Tetteh as more of a defined, real person than the others. The portrayal of these events can also be adjusted using illustration; most of the story is deeply traumatic to Tetteh, and likely extremely personal. To have photographs of her giving birth or feeling broken down in the prison may involve more vulnerability than she is willing to show.</p> 

<p>One of the biggest advantages that this graphic novel utilizes is the ability to create images that are extremely similar to each other, with only the exact small changes that are needed. In this novel, they frequently have a shot of someone before changing it slightly for the next frame - Tetteh’s husband is first introduced with a kind, warm smile and friendly demeanor. The background was soft and pleasant, and matched with the words of Tetteh describing that she was initially happy. The next slide, however, her husband’s expression changes to one of anger and displeasure, and the background becomes redder and more harsh in tone. The text matches this perfectly, with the shift into discussing her husband’s abuse. This technique is used again to show when Alie was taken from Tetteh, and how that affected her. He is shown at first playing in the yard while she watches, smiling. The next slide, he is gone, and the lighting has changed to be warmer, almost like it was the end of the day and there was a sunset. The expression on Tetteh’s face has changed, to one of grief, while the empty space around her emphasizes her loneliness.</p>  

<p>The singular photograph at the end of the novel is not of Tetteh herself, but of a social worker, alongside her quote. The color is vibrant and much closer up than any of the illustrations, and her face is significantly less expressive than the illustration. The composition simply isn’t as interesting, and there is less information to be gained from the photograph itself, most of the communication is done through the caption.</p>
