 <h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>The eye blinking was a bit of a challenge for me because of the way the paths were set up on my Illustrator file - the way they bent was not particularly cooperative, but I was able to make the animation look fairly smooth with 7 frames of the lid closing. For the puppet warp, I chose a stock image to imitate a woman shrugging her shoulders. </p>
