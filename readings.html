<h1>Homework 2</h1>

<h1>Susan Sontag, <em>In Plato's Cave</em></h1>

<p>There are approximately 10,000 photographs stored on my phone right now, with even more scattered on my computer and cloud drives. Despite the sheer amount, most of these photographs are useless to anybody but me - screenshots of funny conversations between my friends, quick photos of lecture slides, and dozens of other benign, everyday subjects. My most important work tends to come in the form of video, where I capture parts of the world that I find the most important, a brief clip of time through my eyes. But photography is not entirely foreign to me, even when I rarely think about the composition of my phone camera the same way I think about the framing in my Panasonic 4K camcorder.</p>

<p>I often attend theatre on Broadway, where seat choice is the most important decision I have to make regarding a performance. Most theatres do not have seats made for a short, wider body like mine; my fellow audience members in the next row down often prove challenging to my own line of sight, and I’ve more than once experienced touching shoulders with my neighbors while I squeezed myself into a seat much too small for me. Other people of other builds have different issues; I often see men taller than 6 feet grimace as they climb into a row with their knees pressed against the seat-backs in front of them. On more than one occasion, I’ve gotten up mid-show in order to let someone in my row leave and end their discomfort.</p>

<p>Since I’ve regularly started attending theatre in 2022, I’ve made it my mission to photograph each seat I buy a ticket for. I ensure the conditions are optimal for what I consider an honest reflection of my experience; the phone is held at my eye level, with my phone shifted slightly to the left so the camera lines up with my line of sight. The person in front of me should be in a position that they are likely to maintain throughout the performance - not leaning forward, nor standing up, but not entirely absent or slumped down into their chair either. The entire width of the stage should be captured, if possible, as well as any potential overhang from the mezzanine or balcony levels. Turning down the exposure often helps with making the photo appear more composed, and hides the faces of any bystanders that happen to be caught in the moment. After all of that, I often crop and filter the image as I please, trying to make the photograph both aesthetic and functional in its use. The final step is to upload it to my site of choice - ViewFromMySeat - which, I’ve noticed over time, adds its own filter to slightly darken any images uploaded. The photo isn’t enough, though, since so many other factors of the seat must be communicated through the caption instead - the legroom, the width of the chair, and proximity to the exit being just a few examples. Even on a website named after the <em>view</em> from a seat, some of the most important information cannot be shown through the image, and instead is hidden behind the thumbnail of an entry. </p>
