<h1>Homework 2</h1>

<h2>Susan Sontag, <em>In Plato's Cave</em></h2>

<p>There are approximately 10,000 photographs stored on my phone right now, with even more scattered on my computer and cloud drives. Despite the sheer amount, most of these photographs are useless to anybody but me - screenshots of funny conversations between my friends, quick photos of lecture slides, and dozens of other benign, everyday subjects. My most important work tends to come in the form of video, where I capture parts of the world that I find the most important, a brief clip of time through my eyes. But photography is not entirely foreign to me, even when I rarely think about the composition of my phone camera the same way I think about the framing in my Panasonic 4K camcorder.</p>

<p>I often attend theatre on Broadway, where seat choice is the most important decision I have to make regarding a performance. Most theatres do not have seats made for a short, wider body like mine; my fellow audience members in the next row down often prove challenging to my own line of sight, and I’ve more than once experienced touching shoulders with my neighbors while I squeezed myself into a seat much too small for me. Other people of other builds have different issues; I often see men taller than 6 feet grimace as they climb into a row with their knees pressed against the seat-backs in front of them. On more than one occasion, I’ve gotten up mid-show in order to let someone in my row leave and end their discomfort.</p>

<p>Since I’ve regularly started attending theatre in 2022, I’ve made it my mission to photograph each seat I buy a ticket for. I ensure the conditions are optimal for what I consider an honest reflection of my experience; the phone is held at my eye level, with my phone shifted slightly to the left so the camera lines up with my line of sight. The person in front of me should be in a position that they are likely to maintain throughout the performance - not leaning forward, nor standing up, but not entirely absent or slumped down into their chair either. The entire width of the stage should be captured, if possible, as well as any potential overhang from the mezzanine or balcony levels. Turning down the exposure often helps with making the photo appear more composed, and hides the faces of any bystanders that happen to be caught in the moment. After all of that, I often crop and filter the image as I please, trying to make the photograph both aesthetic and functional in its use. The final step is to upload it to my site of choice - ViewFromMySeat - which, I’ve noticed over time, adds its own filter to slightly darken any images uploaded. The photo isn’t enough, though, since so many other factors of the seat must be communicated through the caption instead - the legroom, the width of the chair, and proximity to the exit being just a few examples. Even on a website named after the <em>view</em> from a seat, some of the most important information cannot be shown through the image, and instead is hidden behind the thumbnail of an entry. </p>

<h1>Homework 4</h1>

<p>When I first came across AI generated images and videos, I scoffed at my screen. It was a blurry, messily composed digital painting of a person with approximately 13 fingers and colors that faded into each other with no real logic. It was so, so obviously fake. After reading the caption, which explained that it was an AI-generated photo using new technology, I scrolled past and moved on. When my friends talked about AI chat bots and editors, I waved them off, expecting the talk to die down soon as people realized how absurdly flawed these machines’ creations were.</p>

<p>And yet, as time has passed, I am forced to admit that I was wrong. Generative AI has not only gotten more and more prevalent, but the improvement in the quality of its output has been staggering. Still images are now impossibly photorealistic, and videos are already rapidly approaching that same point. I am constantly sending TikToks to my friends asking them to verify if my suspicions on them being AI generated are true, since I am no longer confident in my ability to immediately identify this content. I would consider myself to be better and more aware of this issue than the vast majority of people, as someone who tries to be critical while consuming any type of media. I feel myself going mad as I look in the comments of a video that is so clearly artificial, and nobody else seems to notice. It is an incredibly scary position to be in, and I am constantly training myself to pick apart the authenticity of anything I see, a skill that is only becoming more essential by the day.</p>

<p>“Media literacy” is a word that gets thrown around a lot these days, but for good reason. I used to believe that the ability to identify AI images was directly linked to media literacy as a tool. If one simply remains aware and actively critical, it’s easy to pick out the fake from the real. But that simply isn’t the case anymore. The technology has progressed too far, and humans can’t be on alert every moment of every day, especially while doing things that are meant to be relaxing, like scrolling through social media platforms for short, entertaining videos. The article says it best: “Everything starts to feel both too real and entirely unreal.” Having constant doubts for what I see and hear is terrifying and exhausting, but I can’t call it paranoia if it’s a fear founded on logic and reality. Any person I see on my screen could potentially be fake. Any news article generated by an AI with no real care for facts.</p>

<p>While the ability to edit photographs and videos are nothing new, they were previously gatekept behind a skill barrier. Anyone who wanted to produce fake content needed to know the software in order to do so. But the widespread accessibility of AI has flooded our devices with an overwhelming amount of content, and an increasingly short list of ways to combat it.</p>

<h1>Homework 6</h1>
  
<p>“The Punishment” is almost entirely told through text and illustration, with only two examples of photography and video at the end. The choice to use illustration is likely due to the nature of the story they are presenting. They can’t photograph past events, but they still want the visual aspect of the struggles that Tetteh faces. Text description of her pain and fear, as opposed to seeing it on her face, wouldn’t have been as effective. The visual of her husband’s ghost also gives us more insight into her own perspective, with the blood staining his shirt and his solemn expression playing into her terror.</p>

<p>There is greater control of the amount of detail in each illustration, which can put more focus on certain subjects. For example, when Tetteh is giving birth, the faces of the workers around her are significantly less detailed than her own, leading the viewer to see Tetteh as more of a defined, real person than the others. The portrayal of these events can also be adjusted using illustration; most of the story is deeply traumatic to Tetteh, and likely extremely personal. To have photographs of her giving birth or feeling broken down in the prison may involve more vulnerability than she is willing to show.</p> 

<p>One of the biggest advantages that this graphic novel utilizes is the ability to create images that are extremely similar to each other, with only the exact small changes that are needed. In this novel, they frequently have a shot of someone before changing it slightly for the next frame - Tetteh’s husband is first introduced with a kind, warm smile and friendly demeanor. The background was soft and pleasant, and matched with the words of Tetteh describing that she was initially happy. The next slide, however, her husband’s expression changes to one of anger and displeasure, and the background becomes redder and more harsh in tone. The text matches this perfectly, with the shift into discussing her husband’s abuse. This technique is used again to show when Alie was taken from Tetteh, and how that affected her. He is shown at first playing in the yard while she watches, smiling. The next slide, he is gone, and the lighting has changed to be warmer, almost like it was the end of the day and there was a sunset. The expression on Tetteh’s face has changed, to one of grief, while the empty space around her emphasizes her loneliness.</p>  

<p>The singular photograph at the end of the novel is not of Tetteh herself, but of a social worker, alongside her quote. The color is vibrant and much closer up than any of the illustrations, and her face is significantly less expressive than the illustration. The composition simply isn’t as interesting, and there is less information to be gained from the photograph itself, most of the communication is done through the caption.</p>
