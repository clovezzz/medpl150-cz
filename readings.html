<h1>Homework 2</h1>

<p>Reading Reflection:</p>

<p>There are approximately 10,000 photographs stored on my phone right now, with even more scattered on my computer and cloud drives. Despite the sheer amount, most of these photographs are useless to anybody but me - screenshots of funny conversations between my friends, quick photos of lecture slides, and dozens of other benign, everyday subjects. My most important work tends to come in the form of video, where I capture parts of the world that I find the most important, a brief clip of time through my eyes. But photography is not entirely foreign to me, even when I rarely think about the composition of my phone camera the same way I think about the framing in my Panasonic 4K camcorder.</p>
