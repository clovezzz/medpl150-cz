  <h2>Reflection</h2>
 <p>I wanted to use the image collage to focus on our overuse of and reliance on screens in the modern day. In collage 1, I contrasted the multiple people on their phones with their background, which was of a beautiful landscape that they are all turned away from. I positioned them in ways to make them look separate from each other and playing with depth of field. I used the soft light blending mode alongside a gradient to represent the light coming from their phones, with their faces more lit than their bodies.</p>
<p>For collage 2, I wanted to explore the increasing effects of paywalls and the restriction of access to our own memories. I used the blending modes hard mix and overlay to make a watermark over the child, as well as removing the background of the camera.
