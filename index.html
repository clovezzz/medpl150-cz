<h1>Clove Zhu</h1>

<p>Clove Zhu is a mixed-media artist exploring the intersection of live performance and digital recreation. Located in Queens,
they look to highlight the reality of performer's bodies, the preservation of artform, and the supposed impossibility of both existing. The audience's 
right to spread of information and individual's right to privacy clash, entangle, and merge in their work. With the utilization of all five senses and 
multiple outlets for viewing, they hope to communicate both the conflict and the resolution, the argument and the compromise.</p>
