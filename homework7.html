 <h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>I chose this photo of a landscape because of the geometric shapes that were already present in the image. I wanted to highlight the way the land was divided and contrast them with the set of primary colors I chose. The result was a tile-like pattern, with differentiating colors on the plots of land that were still green and a more solid and consistent color pallette on the plots that were still dirt.</p>
